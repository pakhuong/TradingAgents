"""Sentiment analyst — multi-source sentiment analysis for a target ticker.

Previously named ``social_media_analyst``. Renamed and redesigned because
the old version had a prompt that demanded social-media analysis but the
only tool available was Yahoo Finance news — which led LLMs to fabricate
Reddit/X/StockTwits content under prompt pressure (verified live).

The redesigned agent pre-fetches complementary data sources before the LLM
is invoked and injects them into the prompt as structured blocks. Default
symbols use the US-oriented source set:

  1. News headlines     — Yahoo Finance (institutional framing)
  2. StockTwits messages — retail-trader posts indexed by cashtag, with
                           user-labeled Bullish/Bearish sentiment tags
  3. Reddit posts        — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing

Explicit Vietnam symbols use routed company news plus Vietnam-local news
and optional public forum context instead of US social endpoints.

The agent does not use tool-calling; the data is in the prompt from
turn 0. Output uses the structured-output pattern (json_schema for
OpenAI/xAI, response_schema for Gemini, tool-use for Anthropic), falling
back to free-text generation for providers that lack native support, so
the sentiment header (band + score + confidence) is deterministic across
runs and providers instead of free-form per-model prose.

## Data sources (pre-fetched, in this prompt)

### News headlines — Yahoo Finance, past 7 days
Institutional framing. Fact-driven, slower-moving signal.

<start_of_news>
{news_block}
<end_of_news>

### StockTwits messages — retail-trader social platform indexed by cashtag
Fast-moving signal. Each message carries a user-labeled sentiment tag (Bullish / Bearish / no-label) plus the message body.

<start_of_stocktwits>
{stocktwits_block}
<end_of_stocktwits>

### Reddit posts — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing (past 7 days)
Community discussion. Engagement signal via upvote score and comment count. Subreddit character matters (r/wallstreetbets is often contrarian/exuberant; r/stocks more measured; r/investing longer-term).

<start_of_reddit>
{reddit_block}
<end_of_reddit>

## How to analyze this data (best practices)

1. **Read the StockTwits Bullish/Bearish ratio as a leading retail-sentiment signal.** A 70/30 bullish/bearish split is moderately bullish; ≥90/10 may indicate over-extension and contrarian risk; 50/50 is uncertainty. Sample size matters — base rates on the actual message count, not percentages alone.

2. **Look for cross-source divergences.** If news framing is bearish but StockTwits is overwhelmingly bullish, that mismatch is itself a signal — it can mean retail is leaning into a thesis the news flow hasn't caught up to (or vice versa, that retail is chasing while institutions are cautious).

3. **Weight Reddit posts by engagement.** A 400-upvote / 200-comment thread reflects community attention; a 3-upvote post is noise. Read the body excerpts for context — the title alone often misleads.

4. **Distinguish opinion from event.** A news headline ("Nvidia announces $500M Corning deal") is an event; a StockTwits post ("buying NVDA, this is going to moon") is opinion. Both are inputs but should be weighted differently in your conclusions.

5. **Identify recurring narrative themes.** What topic keeps coming up across sources? That's the dominant narrative driving current sentiment.

6. **Be honest about data limits.** If StockTwits returned only a handful of messages, or one or more sources returned an "<unavailable>" placeholder, the sentiment read is less robust — flag this explicitly in the `confidence` field and the narrative. If the sources are silent on a given subreddit, say so.

7. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources — news of upcoming earnings, product launches, competitive threats, macro headlines, etc.

8. **Past sentiment is not predictive.** Frame your conclusions as signal for the trader to weigh alongside fundamentals and technicals, not as a price call.

## Output fields

Fill the following fields:

- **overall_band**: Exactly one of Bullish / Mildly Bullish / Neutral / Mixed / Mildly Bearish / Bearish. Use Mixed when sources point in clearly different directions; Neutral only when all sources are genuinely silent.
- **overall_score**: A number from 0 (maximally bearish) to 10 (maximally bullish); 5 is neutral. Keep it consistent with overall_band.
- **confidence**: low / medium / high, based on data quality and sample size.
- **narrative**: Full source-by-source breakdown, divergences, dominant narrative themes, catalysts and risks, and a markdown summary table of key sentiment signals (direction, source, supporting evidence).

## Data sources (pre-fetched, in this prompt)

### News headlines and company disclosures
Issuer-scoped company news and disclosures from the configured company-news vendor are included inside the Vietnam source block.

### Vietnam local market news
Local public financial news sources are included where available. Treat formal news, disclosures, and company-specific headlines as higher-confidence evidence than informal discussion.

### Vietnam investor forum discussion
Forum-style investor discussion is optional, noisy, and lower confidence. Use it only as a retail-attention or narrative signal when present.

<start_of_vietnam_sources>
{vietnam_sources_block}
<end_of_vietnam_sources>

## Data limits

Vietnam market social data is less standardized than large US retail-social feeds. Some public pages may return unavailable placeholders, no matching items, guarded-page responses, or sparse ticker mentions. Treat those gaps as data-quality limits, not as evidence of neutral sentiment.

## How to analyze this data (best practices)

1. **Prioritize formal issuer-scoped news and disclosures.** Company events, regulatory filings, financial updates, and exchange-relevant headlines should carry more weight than informal discussion.

2. **Use local financial news for narrative context.** Identify market-wide, sector, liquidity, foreign-flow, policy, or macro stories that may shape sentiment around {ticker}.

3. **Treat forum discussion as noisy.** If public forum items are present, use them to identify recurring retail narratives, crowd attention, and possible rumor risk, but avoid treating them as verified facts.

4. **Look for alignment and divergence.** Compare issuer news, local market news, and any forum discussion. A bullish retail narrative against weak formal news, or negative local headlines against strong company disclosures, is itself useful context.

5. **Be explicit about source quality.** If sources return placeholders, sparse items, or no matches, flag the confidence impact in the report.

6. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources: earnings, dividends, governance changes, sector policy, macro conditions, liquidity, foreign flows, or market-wide volatility.

7. **Past sentiment is not predictive.** Frame your conclusions as signal for the trader to weigh alongside fundamentals and technicals, not as a price call.

## Output

Produce a sentiment report covering, in order:

1. **Overall sentiment direction** — Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / Mixed — with a brief confidence note based on data quality and sample size.
2. **Source-by-source breakdown** — what company news, Vietnam local market news, and any forum discussion are telling you, with specific evidence.
3. **Divergences, alignments, and key narratives** across sources.
4. **Catalysts and risks** surfaced by the data.
5. **Markdown table** at the end summarizing key sentiment signals, their direction, source, and supporting evidence.
